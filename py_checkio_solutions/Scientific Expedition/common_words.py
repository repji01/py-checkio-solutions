# Let's continue examining words. You are given two strings with words separated by commas.    Try to find what is common between these strings. The words in the same string don't repeat.
# 
# Your function should find all of the words that appear in both strings.    The result must be represented as a string of words separated by commas inalphabetic order.
# 
# Input:Two arguments as strings.
# 
# Output:The common words as a string.
# 
# Precondition:
# Each string contains no more than 10 words.
# All words separated by commas.
# All words consist of lowercase latin letters.
